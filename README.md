# Fundament Grid System

A flexbox-first, semantic-if-wanted, mobile-first and customizable SCSS grid system with a robust inline-block fallback.

## Usage:

### General:

>Head over to [the wiki](https://github.com/felics/fundament.grid/wiki) for more detailed information (wip).

### Installation:

To run the included build-process, install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) with NPM globally: `npm install gulp -g`, point your Terminal to the repo-folder and run `npm install`. You can then build the SCSS to `dist` via running `gulp`. If you want to include this grid in your existing project, just copy the contents of `/scss` to your SCSS folder and import `fundament-grid.scss` in your main SCSS-file.


### Configuration:

You can configure the grid-system in `scss/fundament-grid.scss`. For the meaning of each of these options, refer to the wiki (tbd) or the inline documentation in the file. List of options:

```scss
$fdmt-grid: (

    // * Core Settings

    settings: (
        namespace:      "grid",
        item:           "item",
        responsive:     true,
        mobile-first:   true,
        silent-classes: false,
        gutter:         24px
    ),

    // * Breakpoint widths

    breakpoints: (
        palm:           "(max-width: 480px)",
        lap:            "(min-width: 481px)",
        desk:           "(min-width: 1024px)",
        high:           "(min-width: 1500px)"
    ),

    // * Push classes

    push:(
        use-push:         true,

    ),

    // * Pull classes

    pull: (
        use-pull:         true,
        responsive:       false
    ),

    // * Settings for the fallback-grid

    fallback:(
        use-fallback:     true,
        use-markup-fix:   false,
        grid-item-font:  '"Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif'
    ),

    // * Grid modifiers

    modifiers:(
        use-modifiers:  true,
        full:           true,
        rev:            true,
        center:         true,
        right:          true,
        wide:           true,
        narrow:         true,
        bottom:         true,
        middle:         true,
        top:            true,
        space-around:   true,
        space-between:  true,
        even:           true

    ),

    // * Grid widths

    widths: (
        halves:         true,
        thirds:         true,
        quarters:       true,
        fifths:         true,
        sixths:         true,
        eighths:        true,
        tenths:         true,
        twelfths:       true
    ),

    // * Visibility helpers

    visibility-helper: (
        show:           true,
        hide:           true
    )
);
```

### Basic Usage:

The grid system is built on a BEM-synthax. (core--variant__sub-item) For a full list of avaiable modifiers and widths, look into the wiki (tbd) or use the inline documentation.

#### Synthax-Reference:

>Please note that you can set a custom namespace for parent and item and your own breakpoints in the config.

```css
/*! Synthax !*/

/* Parent */

.grid {}

/* Child */

.grid__item {}

/* Modifiers */

.grid--modifier {}
.grid--modifier__item {}

/* Widths */

.one-half {}

/* Responsive widths */

.desk--one-half {}

/* Visibility Helpers */

.desk--grid--show {}

```

#### HTML:

Working with the grid in markup looks like this:

```html

<section class="grid  grid--rev">
    <article class="grid__item  grid--rev__item  one-half  desk--one-third">
        Something
    </article>
    <article class="grid__item  grid--rev__item  one-half  desk--one-third">
        Something
    </article>
</section>

```

>You can check `test/index.html` for a load of usage examples.

#### SCSS:

With silent classes set to true, you can use the grid like this:

```css
.image-grid {
    @extend %grid;
    @extend %grid--rev;
}

.image-grid figure {
    @extend %grid__item;
    @extend %grid--rev__item;
    @extend %one-half;
    @extend %desk--one-third;
}

```

If you are using SCSS but want to have the option to apply the classes to markup, you can set silent-classes to false but still use extends like this:

```css
.image-grid {
    @extend .grid;
    @extend .grid--rev;
}

.image-grid figure {
    @extend .grid__item;
    @extend .grid--rev__item;
    @extend .one-half;
    @extend .desk--one-third;
}

```

### Setting Widths:

The grid is built mobile-first which means that if you set a width without a breakpoint-modifier (e.g. just `one-half`), it will apply to all breakpoints. You can then for example apply `lap--one-third` to make the item one-third on all devices bigger than the lap-breakpoint. To make it even smaller on bigger devices, just set `desk--one-quarter` and this will apply to all devices bigger than-the desk-breakpoint. This means that the grid progressively enhances with bigger viewports and media-query support while still delivering a decent version for smaller, less-capable devices. You can set your own breakpoints with your own names in the config.

>Note: By default, there is still a `palm--` breakpoint for smaller devices that works with max-width to make retro-fitting existing designs easier.

Example task: Build a grid of 2 items that each take the whole screen on mobile, a third and 2-thirds of the screen on lap-devices and  1-quarter and three-quarters on desk-devices.

```html
<section class="grid">
    <article class="grid__item  one-whole  lap--one-third  desk--one-quarter">
        <p>Some Content</p>
    </article>
    <article class="grid__item  one-whole  lap--two-thirds  desk--three-quarters">
        <p>Some Content</p>
    </article>
</section>
```

or

```scss
.container {
    @extend %grid;
}

.item-1 {
    @extend %grid__item;
    @extend %one-whole;
    @extend %lap--one-third;
    @extend %desk--one-quarter;
}

.item-1 {
    @extend %grid__item;
    @extend %one-whole;
    @extend %lap--two-thirds;
    @extend %desk--three-quarters;
}

```

### Using modifiers:

Modifiers get applied to the grid and grid__item's to use modifications of the grid. For a full list and demos, check `test/index.html`.

If you want to use them, the synthax is easy and memorable. Just add `grid--modifier` to the grid-container (you still have to add `grid`, but this may change in a future relase) and `grid--modifier__item` to each item in the modified container.

Example: Using the --narrow modifier.

```html
<section class="grid  grid--narrow">
    <article class="grid__item  grid--narrow__item  one-third">
        <p>Some Content</p>
    </article>
    <article class="grid__item  grid--narrow__item  two-thirds">
        <p>Some Content</p>
    </article>
</section>
```

or

```scss
.container {
    @extend %grid;
    @extend %grid--narrow;
}

.item-1 {
    @extend %grid__item;
    @extend %grid--narrow__item;
    @extend %one-third;
}

.item-1 {
    @extend %grid__item;
    @extend %grid--narrow__item;
    @extend %two-thirds;
}

```

### Using the generated grid in `/dist`:

This repo includes a pre-built version of the grid. To use this version, please make sure to re-set your font-family on `grid__item`(used for inline-block grid) like this:

```css
.grid__item {
    font-family: /* Your font-family */;
}
```

This version is built with the `mobile first`-setting to true, which means that you do not have to set `one-whole` on grid__items because it gets applied by default.
