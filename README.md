        rev:            true,
        center:         true,
        right:          true,

## Basic Usage:

Assuming the defaults, you can use the grid like this:

```css
/* Generated classes look like: */

/* Parent */

.grid {}

/* Child */

.grid__item {}

/* Modifiers */

.grid--modifier {}
.grid__item--modifier {}

/* Widths */

.one-half {}

/* Responsive widths */

.palm--one-half {}

/* Visibility Helpers */

.palm--grid--show {}

```

```html

<section class="grid  grid--rev">
    <article class="grid__item  grid--rev__item  one-half  desk--one-whole">
        Something
    </article>
    <article class="grid__item  grid--rev__item  one-half  desk--one-whole">
        Something
    </article>
</section>

```

With silent classes set to true, you can use the grid like this:

```css
.image-grid {
    @extend %grid;
    @extend %grid--rev;
}

.image-grid figure {
    @extend %grid__item;
    @extend %grid--rev__item;
    @extend %one-half;
    @extend %desk--one-third;
}

```
