# Fundament Grid System

A flexbox-first, inline-block-fallback, semantic and customizable scss grid system. Started as a fork of [css-wizardry-grids](https://github.com/csswizardry/csswizardry-grids). Works & tested in all major browsers. (IE8 with Respond.js)

Features:

 - Uses the new flexbox-syntax where possible, falls back to a solid `display: inline-block`-based grid
 - Fully customizable, including the ability to choose a namespace for grid-classes
 - Mobile first & responsive if needed
 - Can be used with silent classes & extends to minimize code-bloat
 - Small footprint and encapsulated (no variable-bleed)

## Installation

If you use bower, you can simply use:

```
bower install fundament
```

## Requirements

 - SASS 3.3: This project makes extensive use of SASS Maps, which were introduced in the new SASS 3.3.

If you want to build the grid with the build-process included, you need to have `node.js` and `npm` installed. You can init the project like this:

```
npm install
gulp
```
